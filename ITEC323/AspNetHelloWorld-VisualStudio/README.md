## PlanetWroxModern (.NET 10 Razor Pages)

This is a modern, cross‑platform ASP.NET Core Razor Pages version of the original Web Forms project.

### Prerequisites

- .NET 10 SDK installed (`dotnet --info` should work in your terminal).

### How to build and run

```bash
cd "Week 2/PlanetWroxModern"

# restore packages and build
dotnet build

# run the development server
dotnet run
```

By default the app will listen on a URL similar to `https://localhost:5001` or `https://localhost:7043`. The exact URL is printed in the terminal output from `dotnet run`.

Open that URL in your browser to see the home page.
