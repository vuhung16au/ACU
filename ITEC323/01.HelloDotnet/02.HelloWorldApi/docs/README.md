- Best practices and common patterns

**Target Audience**: Students learning web API development for the first time

**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of C# syntax and HTTP concepts

## Quick Navigation

### For Complete Beginners
1. Start with the project [README.md](../README.md) for an overview
2. Follow the [QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md) to get the app running
3. Read [MinimalApiBasics.md](MinimalApiBasics.md) to understand the concepts
4. Review [FRD.md](../FRD.md) to see the detailed requirements

### For Hands-On Learners
1. Get the app running first ([QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md))
2. Experiment with modifying the code
3. Refer to [MinimalApiBasics.md](MinimalApiBasics.md) when you have questions
4. Try the "Next Steps" suggestions in the guides

## How to Read These Docs

### First Time Through
1. Read sequentially from start to finish
2. Don't worry if you don't understand everything immediately
3. Focus on the "What" before worrying about the "Why"
4. Come back to difficult sections after you've experimented

### As Reference Material
- Use the table of contents to jump to specific topics
- Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F) to search for specific terms
- Focus on code examples that are relevant to your task
- Check "Common Patterns" and "Best Practices" sections

### When Stuck
1. Check the "Troubleshooting Guide" section
2. Review the relevant concept section
3. Look at code examples similar to what you're trying to do
4. Try the simpler examples before complex ones

## Questions?

If after reading all documentation you still have questions:

1. **Check the code**: Sometimes reading the implementation helps
2. **Experiment**: Try changing things to see what happens
3. **Debug**: Use breakpoints to step through the code
4. **Ask**: Reach out to instructors or classmates
5. **Research**: Look for additional resources online

Remember: Confusion is part of learning. Don't be discouraged if concepts don't click immediately!
