# EF Core + SQLite Basics

This guide explains the core concepts used in the `04.Data` project.

## 1. Why EF Core?

EF Core lets you work with databases using C# classes. Instead of writing SQL for every operation, you can:
- Create objects
- Save them with `SaveChanges()`
- Query using LINQ

## 2. Why SQLite?

SQLite is ideal for beginner projects because:
- It is file-based (`app.db`)
- No database server setup is required
- It is fast for small educational demos

## 3. Main Building Blocks

### Model (`Student`)
Represents one row in the database table.

### DbContext (`AppDbContext`)
Represents a session with the database and exposes tables as `DbSet<T>`.

### Program (`Program.cs`)
Runs the CRUD workflow step by step in one place so you can see the full process.

## 4. Migrations

Migrations are versioned schema changes generated by EF Core.

- `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate`
  - Creates migration files based on your model
- `dotnet ef database update`
  - Applies pending migrations to `app.db`

## 5. CRUD Flow in This Project

1. **Create**: Insert a student (`Alice`)
2. **Read**: Retrieve that row by `Id`
3. **Update**: Change name to `Alice Updated`
4. **Delete**: Remove the row
5. **Final Check**: Confirm row count is zero

## 6. Key Learning Point

For beginner learning, keep data logic explicit and local:
- One model
- One context
- One program file showing end-to-end behavior

This makes it easier to understand how EF Core interacts with SQLite before moving to larger architecture patterns.
