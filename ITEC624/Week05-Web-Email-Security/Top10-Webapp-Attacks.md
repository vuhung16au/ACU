# Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers inject malicious scripts into websites viewed by other users.
2. **SQL Injection:** Malicious SQL commands are sent to a database via input fields, exposing confidential data.
3. **Path Traversal:** Attackers manipulate file paths to access files/folders outside intended directories.
4. **Information Leakage:** Sensitive info is unintentionally exposed (through error messages, headers, etc.).
5. **OS Commanding:** Malicious input leads the app to execute unintended system-level commands.
6. **XML Injection:** Attackers inject malicious XML content, affecting how data is parsed or processed.
7. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers trick a server into making unintended requests (often targeting internal resources).
8. **Denial of Service (DoS):** The app is overwhelmed, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
9. **HTTP Verb Tampering:** Attackers manipulate HTTP methods (verbs) to bypass restrictions or access hidden resources.
10. **Server-Side Template Injection:** Malicious input modifies server-side templates, leading to code execution or information disclosure.
