IN CRYPTOGRAPHY A CAESAR CIPHER ALSO KNOWN AS CAESAR SHIFT CIPHER OR SHIFT CIPHER IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND MOST WIDELY KNOWN ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUES. IT IS A TYPE OF SUBSTITUTION CIPHER IN WHICH EACH LETTER IN THE PLAINTEXT IS REPLACED BY A LETTER SOME FIXED NUMBER OF POSITIONS DOWN THE ALPHABET. FOR EXAMPLE WITH A LEFT SHIFT OF THREE D WOULD BE REPLACED BY A E WOULD BECOME B AND SO ON. THE METHOD IS NAMED AFTER JULIUS CAESAR WHO USED IT IN HIS PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE. THE ENCRYPTION STEP PERFORMED BY A CAESAR CIPHER IS OFTEN INCORPORATED AS PART OF MORE COMPLEX SCHEMES SUCH AS THE VIGENERE CIPHER AND STILL HAS MODERN APPLICATIONS IN THE ROT THIRTEEN SYSTEM.
