TO BE OR NOT TO BE, THAT IS THE QUESTION:
WHETHER 'TIS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO SUFFER
THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE,
OR TO TAKE ARMS AGAINST A SEA OF TROUBLES
AND BY OPPOSING END THEM. TO DIEâ€”TO SLEEP,
NO MORE; AND BY A SLEEP TO SAY WE END
THE HEART-ACHE AND THE THOUSAND NATURAL SHOCKS
THAT FLESH IS HEIR TO: 'TIS A CONSUMMATION
DEVOUTLY TO BE WISH'D.
