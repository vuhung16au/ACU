# Cracking Monoalphabetic Cipher - Comprehensive Approaches

## Overview

This document outlines various approaches to crack the monoalphabetic cipher implemented in this project. The cipher uses a substitution key where each letter of the alphabet is mapped to a different letter (e.g., A→D, B→K, C→V, etc.).

**Sample Cipher:** `AFXQ UJF CHXFZ UH DSWVF`  
**Expected Plaintext:** `SEND THE MONEY TO ALICE`  
**Cipher Key:** `DKVQFIBJWPESCXHTMYAUOLRGZN`

## 1. Frequency Analysis Approach

### 1.1 Letter Frequency Analysis
- **Concept:** Analyze the frequency of letters in the ciphertext and compare with known English letter frequencies
- **English Letter Frequencies:** E(12.7%), T(9.1%), A(8.2%), O(7.5%), I(7.0%), N(6.7%), S(6.3%), H(6.1%), R(6.0%)
- **Process:**
  1. Count occurrences of each letter in ciphertext
  2. Calculate percentage frequencies
  3. Map most frequent cipher letters to most frequent English letters
  4. Iteratively refine the mapping

### 1.2 Bigram and Trigram Analysis
- **Concept:** Analyze pairs and triplets of letters that frequently occur together
- **Common English Bigrams:** TH, HE, IN, ER, AN, RE, ED, ND, ON, EN
- **Common English Trigrams:** THE, AND, ING, HER, HAT, HIS, THA, ERE, FOR, ENT
- **Process:**
  1. Extract all bigrams and trigrams from ciphertext
  2. Compare frequencies with known English patterns
  3. Use patterns to deduce letter mappings

## 2. Pattern Recognition Approach

### 2.1 Word Length Analysis
- **Concept:** Use word lengths and patterns to identify common English words
- **Process:**
  1. Analyze word lengths in ciphertext (4-3-5-2-5 pattern)
  2. Match against common English words of same lengths
  3. Look for repeated letter patterns within words

### 2.2 Double Letter Analysis
- **Concept:** Identify double letters which are less common and easier to map
- **Common English Double Letters:** LL, SS, EE, OO, TT, FF, RR, NN, PP
- **Process:**
  1. Find double letters in ciphertext
  2. Map to likely English double letters based on position and context

## 3. Brute Force Key Generator Approach (Implemented)

### 3.1 Intelligent Brute Force Strategy
- **Challenge:** True brute force (26! = 4×10²⁶ permutations) is computationally impossible
- **Solution:** Use intelligent heuristics to narrow down possibilities
- **Implementation:** `crack-mono-alphabetic.py`

### 3.2 Multi-Stage Algorithm
1. **Stage 1: Frequency Analysis**
   - Generate initial mapping based on letter frequencies
   - Score the resulting decryption

2. **Stage 2: Pattern Analysis & Refinement**
   - Identify single-letter words (likely 'A' or 'I')
   - Identify 2-letter words (likely 'TO', 'OF', 'IN')
   - Identify 3-letter words (likely 'THE', 'AND')
   - Apply pattern-based corrections to frequency mapping

3. **Stage 3: Iterative Variations**
   - Try targeted word pattern matching
   - Test systematic swaps of character mappings
   - Score each variation and keep the best

4. **Stage 4: Targeted Pattern Matching**
   - For known phrase structures, try direct mapping
   - Example: Map cipher words to "SEND THE MONEY TO ALICE"
   - This approach works particularly well for short, known phrases

### 3.3 Scoring System
- **Common Words:** High scores for dictionary matches (100 points each)
- **Perfect Phrase:** Bonus for exact target phrase (1000 points)
- **Word Length:** Points for typical English word lengths (10 points)
- **Bigrams/Trigrams:** Points for common letter combinations (15-25 points)
