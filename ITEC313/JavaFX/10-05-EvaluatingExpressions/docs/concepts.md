### Concepts

- Infix notation: operators between operands (e.g., `3 + 4`)
- Operator precedence: `*` and `/` bind tighter than `+` and `-`
- Parentheses override precedence
- Two-stack evaluation (Dijkstra): one stack for numbers, one for operators
- Unary minus: interpret `-x` as `0 - x` when a number is expected
