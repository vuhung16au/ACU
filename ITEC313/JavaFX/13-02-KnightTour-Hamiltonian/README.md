# Knight's Tour as a Hamiltonian Cycle â€“ JavaFX Application

![Knight's Tour as a Hamiltonian Cycle](images/KnightTour-Hamiltonian.png)

## Overview

This JavaFX application demonstrates the **Knight's Tour as a Hamiltonian cycle**. We model the 8Ã—8 chessboard as a graph where each square is a vertex and edges connect squares that are a valid knight move apart. A closed knightâ€™s tour corresponds to a **Hamiltonian cycle** in this graph: a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the start.

The application provides an interactive visualization where users can:
- Place a knight on any starting square by clicking
- Watch an animated solution of a closed Knight's Tour (cycle)
- See the complete path traced on the chessboard
- Reset and try different starting positions

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Functionality

1. **Interactive Chessboard** - 8x8 grid with alternating light and dark squares
2. **Knight Placement** - Click any square to place the knight (â™˜ symbol)
3. **Animated Solution** - Watch the knight move through the complete tour
4. **Path Visualization** - Red lines show the knight's path
5. **Move Numbering** - Each visited square shows its move number
6. **Reset Functionality** - Start over with a new position

### ðŸš€ Key Features

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Java**: OpenJDK 24 or later
- **Maven**: 3.9.x or later
- **JavaFX**: 24 (included in dependencies)

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Using Run Scripts (Recommended)
```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
./run.sh

# Windows
run.bat
```

#### Option 2: Direct Maven Commands
```bash
# Clean and compile
mvn clean compile

# Run the application
mvn javafx:run

# Run tests
mvn test

# Build executable JAR
mvn clean package
```

#### Option 3: Build and Run JAR
```bash
# Build the project
mvn clean package

# Run the application
java -jar target/knight-tour-demo-hamiltonian-cycle-1.0.0.jar
```

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Launch the Application**: Run using one of the methods above
2. **Place the Knight**: Click on any square to place the knight
3. **Start the Tour**: Click the "Solve" button to begin the animation
4. **Watch the Solution**: Observe the knight moving through all 64 squares
5. **Try Again**: Click "Reset" to try a different starting position

### Understanding the Interface

- **Chessboard**: 8x8 grid with alternating colors
- **Knight Symbol**: â™˜ represents the knight piece
- **Red Lines**: Show the path the knight will take
- **Blue Numbers**: Indicate the order of moves
- **Status Bar**: Shows current instructions and progress

### How the Algorithm Works (Reduction to Hamiltonian Cycle)

The application reduces the Knightâ€™s Tour to a Hamiltonian cycle problem on the knight move graph and uses **backtracking with pruning**:

1. **Start**: Place knight on chosen square (start vertex)
2. **Explore**: Try edges to unvisited neighbors (valid knight moves)
3. **Recurse**: Continue until all 64 vertices are visited
4. **Cycle Constraint**: Only accept solutions where the last vertex has an edge back to the start
5. **Backtrack**: Undo moves when stuck and try alternatives

## Technical Details

### Knight's Tour as Hamiltonian Cycle

#### What is the Knight's Tour?
The Knight's Tour is a sequence of moves by a knight on a chessboard such that:
- The knight visits every square exactly once
- The knight follows standard chess movement rules (L-shaped moves)
- The tour can be either open (start and end are different) or closed (start and end are adjacent)

#### Knight Movement Rules
A knight moves in an L-shape:
- 2 squares in one direction (horizontal or vertical)
- 1 square in the perpendicular direction
- Total of 8 possible moves from any position (except near edges)

#### Algorithm Implementation (Closed Tour)
```java
// Backtracking for closed tour (Hamiltonian cycle)
private boolean solveRecursiveClosed(int row, int col, Position start,
                                     boolean[][] visited, List<Position> path, int moveCount) {
    if (moveCount == 64) {
        return isValidKnightMove(new Position(row, col), start);
    }
    for (int[] move : KNIGHT_MOVES) {
        int newRow = row + move[0];
        int newCol = col + move[1];
        if (isValidMove(newRow, newCol, visited)) {
            visited[newRow][newCol] = true;
            path.add(new Position(newRow, newCol));
            if (solveRecursiveClosed(newRow, newCol, start, visited, path, moveCount + 1)) {
                return true;
            }
            visited[newRow][newCol] = false;
            path.remove(path.size() - 1);
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern:

- **KnightTourDemo**: Main application class, handles UI and user interactions
- **ChessBoard**: Custom JavaFX component for the chessboard visualization
- **KnightTourSolver**: Contains the core algorithm and animation logic

#### Key Design Patterns
- **MVC Pattern**: Separation of UI, logic, and data
- **Observer Pattern**: Event handling for user interactions
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different solving approaches (extensible)
- **Command Pattern**: Animation and user action handling

## Testing

```

### Adding New Features

1. **New Solving Algorithms**: Implement different approaches (Warnsdorff's algorithm, etc.)
2. **Different Board Sizes**: Support for non-8x8 boards
3. **Tour Types**: Open vs. closed tours
4. **Performance Metrics**: Timing and move counting
5. **Save/Load**: Persist solutions to files

### Code Style

The project follows Java coding conventions:
- **Naming**: camelCase for methods/variables, PascalCase for classes
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JavaDoc comments
- **Structure**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling and validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. JavaFX Not Found
**Error**: `JavaFX runtime components are missing`
**Solution**: Ensure JavaFX dependencies are properly configured in `pom.xml`

#### 2. Compilation Errors
**Error**: `Cannot find symbol` or compilation failures
**Solution**: 
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

#### 3. No Solution Found
**Error**: Application shows "No solution found"
**Solution**: This is normal for some starting positions. Try different starting squares.

#### 4. Animation Too Fast/Slow
**Solution**: Modify `ANIMATION_INTERVAL` in `KnightTourSolver.java`

### Debug Mode

Run with debug output:
```bash
mvn javafx:run -Djavafx.debug=true
```

### Performance Issues

For large boards or slow performance:
```bash
# Increase JVM heap size
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx2g"
mvn javafx:run
```
