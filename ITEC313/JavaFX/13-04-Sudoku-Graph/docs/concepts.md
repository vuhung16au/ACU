# Sudoku Solver - Graph Theory Concepts

## Overview

This Sudoku Solver application demonstrates advanced computer science concepts through the implementation of graph theory algorithms for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). The application transforms the traditional Sudoku puzzle into a graph-based problem and uses sophisticated algorithms to find solutions efficiently.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)

A Constraint Satisfaction Problem consists of:
- **Variables**: The unknowns we need to solve for
- **Domains**: The set of possible values for each variable
- **Constraints**: Rules that limit the combinations of values

In Sudoku:
- **Variables**: 81 cells in the 9×9 grid
- **Domains**: Each cell can contain values 1-9 (or be empty)
- **Constraints**: 
  - Row constraint: No duplicate values in any row
  - Column constraint: No duplicate values in any column
  - Box constraint: No duplicate values in any 3×3 subgrid

### 2. Graph Theory Fundamentals

#### Constraint Graph
- **Vertices**: Each Sudoku cell represents a vertex
- **Edges**: Connect cells that share constraints (same row, column, or 3×3 box)
- **Graph Properties**:
  - 81 vertices (one per cell)
  - Approximately 810 edges (each cell connects to 20 others on average)
  - Dense graph with high connectivity

#### Graph Representation
```java
// Each cell is a vertex
public static class Cell {
    public final int row;
    public final int col;
}

// Constraint graph maps each cell to its constrained neighbors
Map<Cell, Set<Cell>> constraints;

// Domain maps each cell to its possible values
Map<Cell, Set<Integer>> domains;
```

### 3. Arc Consistency

Arc consistency is a fundamental concept in CSP solving that ensures:
- For every value in a cell's domain, there exists at least one valid value in each constrained cell's domain
- Eliminates values that cannot be part of any solution
- Reduces the search space before attempting to solve

#### Arc Consistency Algorithm
```java
private boolean arcConsistency() {
    Queue<Cell> queue = new LinkedList<>(cells);
    
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        Cell cell = queue.poll();
        Set<Integer> domain = domains.get(cell);
        Set<Integer> toRemove = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int value : domain) {
            boolean hasValidSupport = false;
            
            // Check if this value has support in all constrained cells
            for (Cell neighbor : constraints.get(cell)) {
                Set<Integer> neighborDomain = domains.get(neighbor);
                
                for (int neighborValue : neighborDomain) {
                    if (neighborValue != value) {
                        hasValidSupport = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                
                if (!hasValidSupport) break;
            }
            
            if (!hasValidSupport) {
                toRemove.add(value);
            }
        }
        
        domain.removeAll(toRemove);
        
        if (domain.isEmpty()) {
            return false; // No solution possible
        }
        
        // If domain was reduced, add constrained cells back to queue
        if (!toRemove.isEmpty()) {
            for (Cell neighbor : constraints.get(cell)) {
                if (!queue.contains(neighbor)) {
                    queue.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### 4. Heuristic Search Strategies

#### Most Constrained Variable (MCV)
- Choose the variable (cell) with the fewest remaining valid values
- Reduces the branching factor in the search tree
- Helps identify cells that are most likely to lead to dead ends

```java
private Cell findMostConstrainedVariable() {
    Cell bestCell = null;
    int minDomainSize = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    
    for (Cell cell : cells) {
        Set<Integer> domain = domains.get(cell);
        if (domain.size() > 1 && domain.size() < minDomainSize) {
            minDomainSize = domain.size();
            bestCell = cell;
        }
    }
    
    return bestCell;
}
```

#### Least Constraining Value (LCV)
- Choose the value that eliminates the fewest options from other cells
- Preserves future choices and reduces the likelihood of backtracking
- Helps maintain a larger search space for subsequent assignments

```java
private List<Integer> getLeastConstrainingValues(Cell cell) {
    List<Integer> values = new ArrayList<>(domains.get(cell));
    
    // Sort by how many options this value eliminates from other cells
    values.sort((v1, v2) -> {
        int eliminations1 = countEliminations(cell, v1);
        int eliminations2 = countEliminations(cell, v2);
        return Integer.compare(eliminations1, eliminations2);
    });
    
    return values;
}
```

### 5. Forward Checking

Forward checking is a technique that:
- Updates the domains of unassigned variables when a new assignment is made
- Detects dead ends early by checking if any variable's domain becomes empty
- Propagates constraints through the graph in real-time

#### Forward Checking Implementation
```java
private boolean isValidAssignment(int[][] grid, Cell cell, int value) {
    // Check row constraint
    for (int col = 0; col < GRID_SIZE; col++) {
        if (col != cell.col && grid[cell.row][col] == value) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    // Check column constraint
    for (int row = 0; row < GRID_SIZE; row++) {
        if (row != cell.row && grid[row][cell.col] == value) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    // Check 3x3 box constraint
    int boxRow = (cell.row / BOX_SIZE) * BOX_SIZE;
    int boxCol = (cell.col / BOX_SIZE) * BOX_SIZE;
    
    for (int row = boxRow; row < boxRow + BOX_SIZE; row++) {
        for (int col = boxCol; col < boxCol + BOX_SIZE; col++) {
            if ((row != cell.row || col != cell.col) && grid[row][col] == value) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### 6. Constraint Propagation

Constraint propagation is the process of:
- Spreading the effects of an assignment through the constraint graph
- Updating domains of affected variables
- Maintaining consistency throughout the search process

#### Constraint Propagation Benefits
- **Early Detection**: Identifies impossible assignments before exploring them
- **Search Space Reduction**: Eliminates invalid branches from the search tree
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the number of backtracking steps required

### 7. Graph Visualization

The application includes graph visualization capabilities that show:
- **Constraint Relationships**: How cells are connected through Sudoku rules
- **Domain Information**: Current possible values for each cell
- **Graph Structure**: The overall connectivity pattern of the constraint graph

#### Visualization Features
- **Color-coded Edges**: Different colors for row, column, and box constraints
- **Domain Size Display**: Shows the number of possible values for each cell
- **Interactive Highlighting**: Focus on specific cells and their constraints
- **Real-time Updates**: See how domains change during solving

### 8. Algorithm Complexity

#### Time Complexity
- **Worst Case**: O(9^(empty_cells)) - exponential in the number of empty cells
- **Average Case**: Much better due to constraint propagation and heuristics
- **Best Case**: O(1) if puzzle is already solved or has no solution

#### Space Complexity
- **Constraint Graph**: O(81) vertices + O(810) edges = O(1) for fixed Sudoku size
- **Domain Storage**: O(81 × 9) = O(1) for fixed Sudoku size
- **Recursion Stack**: O(empty_cells) in worst case

#### Performance Improvements
- **Arc Consistency**: Reduces search space before solving
- **Heuristic Ordering**: Minimizes branching factor
- **Forward Checking**: Early detection of dead ends
- **Constraint Propagation**: Maintains consistency efficiently

### 9. Educational Value

This implementation demonstrates:
- **Graph Theory**: Practical application of graph concepts
- **Algorithm Design**: Heuristic search and constraint satisfaction

### 10. Real-world Applications

The concepts used in this Sudoku solver apply to many real-world problems:
- **Scheduling**: Assigning resources to tasks with constraints
- **Planning**: Finding valid sequences of actions

- **Optimization**: Finding solutions that satisfy multiple constraints

## Conclusion

The Graph Theory-based Sudoku solver demonstrates how advanced computer science concepts can be applied to solve complex constraint satisfaction problems.
