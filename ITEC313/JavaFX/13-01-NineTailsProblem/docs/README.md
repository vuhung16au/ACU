# Docs â€“ Nine Tails Problem

This module demonstrates mapping a puzzle to a shortest-path problem.

- Nodes: all 2^(N*N) boards encoded as bitsets.
- Edge uâ†’v: one legal flip at a head in u transforms u to v.
- BFS rooted at the target (all tails) gives shortest paths from any start.

Open the app and press "Solve" to see the minimal sequence animated.

## Graph Theory Documentation

This documentation suite provides comprehensive coverage of graph theory concepts, from basic definitions to advanced mathematical foundations:

A complete introduction to graph theory covering:
- Fundamental concepts and definitions
- Types of graphs and their properties
- Real-world applications and examples
- Graph representations and algorithms
- Classic graph problems and solutions

### ðŸ’» [Graph Theory: Practical Examples](./graph-theory-examples.md)
Hands-on implementations and code examples:
- Java and Python implementations
- Traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS)
- Shortest path algorithms
- Real-world problem solutions
- Performance analysis and complexity

### ðŸ§® [Graph Theory: Mathematical Foundations](./graph-theory-mathematical-foundations.md)
Mathematical rigor and theoretical foundations:
- Formal definitions and theorems
- Proof techniques and examples
- Combinatorial properties
- Algebraic graph theory
- Advanced mathematical concepts

## Quick Start

1. **Beginners**: Start with the [Comprehensive Guide](./graph-theory-comprehensive.md) for a complete overview
2. **Developers**: Jump to [Practical Examples](./graph-theory-examples.md) for code implementations
3. **Mathematicians**: Explore [Mathematical Foundations](./graph-theory-mathematical-foundations.md) for theoretical depth

Each document is self-contained but designed to complement the others, providing both practical understanding and theoretical rigor for graph theory concepts.
