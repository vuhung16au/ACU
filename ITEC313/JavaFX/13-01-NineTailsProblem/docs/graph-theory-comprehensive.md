## Introduction to Graph Theory

**Graph theory** is a fundamental branch of mathematics and computer science that studies networks—collections of objects (called vertices or nodes) connected by relationships (called edges). At its core, graph theory provides a powerful framework for modeling and analyzing complex systems where relationships between entities are crucial.

### What Makes Graphs Special?

Graphs are incredibly versatile because they can represent almost any system with interconnected components:
- **Social networks**: People connected by friendships
- **Transportation systems**: Cities connected by roads
- **Computer networks**: Devices connected by communication links
- **Biological systems**: Molecules connected by chemical bonds
- **Puzzle solving**: Game states connected by valid moves

### Historical Context

Graph theory has its roots in the famous "Seven Bridges of Königsberg" problem solved by Leonhard Euler in 1736, which laid the foundation for what would become one of the most important areas of discrete mathematics.

## Fundamental Definitions

### Basic Graph Definition

A **graph** G is formally defined as an ordered pair G = (V, E) where:
- **V** is a set of vertices (also called nodes)
- **E** is a set of edges (also called arcs or links)

### Mathematical Notation

For a graph G = (V, E):
- |V| = n (number of vertices)
- |E| = m (number of edges)
- Each edge e ∈ E connects two vertices u, v ∈ V

### Example

```
V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
E = {(0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4)}
```

This represents a graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges.

## Essential Terminology

### 1. **Vertex (Node)**
- A fundamental unit of a graph
- Represents an entity or object
- **Example**: In a social network, each person is a vertex

### 2. **Edge**
- A connection between two vertices
- Represents a relationship or interaction
- **Example**: A friendship between two people

### 3. **Neighbors (Adjacent Vertices)**
- Two vertices are neighbors if they share an edge
- **Example**: If there's an edge between Alice and Bob, they are neighbors

### 4. **Degree**
- **Degree of a vertex**: Number of edges incident to that vertex
- **In-degree**: Number of edges pointing to a vertex (in directed graphs)
- **Out-degree**: Number of edges pointing from a vertex (in directed graphs)

**Example**:
```
Vertex A has degree 3 (connected to B, C, D)
Vertex B has degree 2 (connected to A, E)
```

### 5. **Path**
- A sequence of vertices where consecutive vertices are connected by edges
- **Length**: Number of edges in the path
- **Simple path**: No vertex is repeated

**Example**: Path from A to D: A → B → C → D

### 6. **Cycle**
- A path that starts and ends at the same vertex
- **Simple cycle**: No vertex is repeated except the start/end

**Example**: A → B → C → A

### 7. **Connectivity**
- **Connected vertices**: There exists a path between them
- **Connected graph**: Every pair of vertices is connected
- **Connected component**: A maximal connected subgraph

### 8. **Subgraph**
- A graph formed by a subset of vertices and edges from the original graph
- **Induced subgraph**: Contains all edges from the original graph between selected vertices

## Types of Graphs

### 1. **Undirected Graphs**

**Definition**: Edges have no direction; (u,v) = (v,u)

**Characteristics**:
- Symmetric relationships
- Degree = number of incident edges
- Common in social networks, road networks

**Example**:
```
Friendship network:
- Alice ↔ Bob (they are mutual friends)
- Bob ↔ Charlie (they are mutual friends)
```

### 2. **Directed Graphs (Digraphs)**

**Definition**: Edges have direction; (u,v) ≠ (v,u)

**Characteristics**:
- Asymmetric relationships
- In-degree and out-degree concepts
- Common in web links, dependencies

**Example**:
```
Web page links:
- Page A → Page B (A links to B)
- Page B → Page C (B links to C)
- But C might not link back to B
```

### 3. **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**

**Definition**: Directed graphs with no cycles

**Characteristics**:
- No circular dependencies
- Can be topologically sorted
- Common in task scheduling, compilation

**Example**:
```
Course prerequisites:
- Math 101 → Math 201
- Math 201 → Math 301
- No cycle possible (can't have Math 301 → Math 101)
```

### 4. **Weighted Graphs**

**Definition**: Edges have associated weights (costs, distances, capacities)

**Characteristics**:
- Weights represent costs, distances, or capacities
- Algorithms must consider edge weights
- Common in transportation, network routing

**Example**:
```
Road network with distances:
- City A --5km-- City B
- City B --3km-- City C
- City A --8km-- City C
```

### 5. **Trees**

**Definition**: Connected, acyclic graphs

**Characteristics**:
- Exactly n-1 edges for n vertices
- Unique path between any two vertices
- Hierarchical structure
- Common in file systems, decision trees

**Example**:
```
File system structure:
/
├── Documents/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   └── file2.txt
└── Pictures/
    └── photo.jpg
```

### 6. **Bipartite Graphs**

**Definition**: Vertices can be divided into two sets such that no edge connects vertices within the same set

**Characteristics**:
- Two disjoint vertex sets
- Edges only between different sets
- Common in matching problems

**Example**:
```
Job assignment:
Jobs: {Job1, Job2, Job3}
Workers: {Alice, Bob, Charlie}
Edges: {(Job1, Alice), (Job1, Bob), (Job2, Charlie), (Job3, Alice)}
```
