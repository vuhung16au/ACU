# Connected Circles â€“ JavaFX Application

## Overview

An educational JavaFX app that applies Depthâ€‘First Search (DFS) to determine whether userâ€‘created circles on a plane form a connected graph. Each circle is a vertex; two vertices are adjacent if the circles overlap or touch.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Interactions
1. Click to add a circle at the cursor (radius selector: 10â€“100; default 20)
2. Drag to move circles
3. Color selector: Purple, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow (default Purple)
4. Same Color Check (on by default): validates connectivity within each color group
5. Randomize: adds 10 circles with random positions/radii/colors
6. Reset: clears the canvas
7. Check: paints circles filled when connected and shows the result dialog
8. Algorithm / Help / About dialogs

### ðŸŽ¨ ACU Color Scheme
The UI uses ACU colors (Purple, Red, Warm Stone, Deep Charcoal, Soft Ivory).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 21+
- Maven 3.9+

### Run
```bash
mvn clean compile
mvn test
mvn javafx:run
```

## How It Works

1. Build an overlap graph: add an edge when distance(centerA, centerB) â‰¤ rA + rB
2. Run DFS from any vertex
3. If all vertices are discovered, the set is connected
4. With Same Color Check enabled, each color group must be connected
