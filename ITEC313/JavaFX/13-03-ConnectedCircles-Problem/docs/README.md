# Connected Circles - Docs

This app models an overlap graph of circles and uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to test connectivity.

- Add circles by clicking; drag to move.
- Two circles are adjacent if the distance between centers is <= rA + rB.
- DFS visits from one vertex; if all are reached, the set is connected.
- Optional Same-Color mode checks connectivity within each color group.
