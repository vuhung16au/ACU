# Largest Block Problem - JavaFX Application

## Overview

This JavaFX application solves the **Largest Block Problem** (Exercise 22.19), which involves finding the largest square submatrix consisting entirely of 1s in a binary matrix. The application provides an interactive interface for exploring this classic dynamic programming problem.

## Algorithm Explanation

### Problem Statement
Given a binary matrix containing only 0s and 1s, find the largest square submatrix that consists entirely of 1s.

### Dynamic Programming Solution

The algorithm uses dynamic programming with the following approach:

1. **DP Table**: `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the largest square with bottom-right corner at position `(i,j)`

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If `matrix[i][j] = 0`, then `dp[i][j] = 0`
   - If `matrix[i][j] = 1` and we're at the first row or column, then `dp[i][j] = 1`

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   ```
   dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
   ```
   This ensures that we can only extend a square if all three neighboring cells can form a valid square.

4. **Result**: The maximum value in the DP table gives us the size of the largest square, and its position gives us the bottom-right corner.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²) where n is the dimension of the matrix
- **Space Complexity**: O(nÂ²) for the DP table

### Why This Works

The key insight is that for a cell `(i,j)` to be part of a square of size `k`, the three cells `(i-1,j)`, `(i,j-1)`, and `(i-1,j-1)` must all be part of squares of size at least `k-1`. By taking the minimum of these three values and adding 1, we ensure that we can only extend the square if all three directions support it.

## Algorithm Details

### Dynamic Programming Approach

The algorithm builds a DP table where each cell `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the largest square with bottom-right corner at `(i,j)`.

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initialize**: Create a DP table of the same size as the input matrix
2. **Fill Base Cases**: Handle first row and column (can only be 1x1 squares)
3. **Apply Recurrence**: For each cell, use the minimum of three neighbors
4. **Track Maximum**: Keep track of the largest square found
5. **Return Result**: Size and position of the largest square

#### Example Walkthrough

Consider this 4x4 matrix:
```
1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1
0 0 1 1
```

The DP table would be:
```
1 1 0 0
1 2 1 0
0 1 2 1
0 0 1 2
```

The maximum value is 2, indicating a 2x2 square at position (3,3).

### Why Dynamic Programming?

- **Optimal Substructure**: The solution to a larger problem depends on solutions to smaller subproblems
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: The same subproblems are solved multiple times
- **Efficiency**: O(nÂ²) time complexity vs O(nÂ³) for naive approach
