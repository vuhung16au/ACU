Core Concepts

- Graph: set of nodes (cities) connected by weighted edges (distances).
- Path cost: sum of edge weights along a route.
- Dijkstra: greedy algorithm for shortest path with nonâ€‘negative edges.
- Visualisation: cities are plotted on the Australia map; edges show weights; the computed path is highlighted in red.

Glossary
- Node/Vertex: a city in the network.
- Edge: a road connection; undirected in this app; weight is distance in kilometres.
- Source/Target: start and destination cities.
- Predecessor map: stores the parent of each node on the shortest path tree for reconstruction.
