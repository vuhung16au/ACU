# Convex Hull Algorithm - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Convex Hull algorithm finds the smallest convex polygon that contains all given points. This document explains the Graham Scan algorithm implementation used in this project.

## Algorithm: Graham Scan

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Find Bottom Point**
   - Locate the point with the smallest y-coordinate
   - If multiple points have the same y-coordinate, choose the leftmost one
   - This point is guaranteed to be on the convex hull

2. **Sort by Polar Angle**
   - Calculate the polar angle of each point with respect to the bottom point
   - Sort points by this angle in ascending order
   - Points with the same angle are sorted by distance from the bottom point

3. **Graham Scan**
   - Start with the bottom point and the next point in sorted order
   - For each subsequent point:
     - Calculate the cross product to determine turn direction
     - If the turn is clockwise (right turn), remove the previous point
     - Continue until all points are processed

### Mathematical Foundation

#### Polar Angle Calculation
```
angle = atan2(y - bottom_y, x - bottom_x)
```

#### Cross Product for Turn Detection
```
cross_product = (p2.x - p1.x) * (p3.y - p1.y) - (p2.y - p1.y) * (p3.x - p1.x)
```

- **Positive**: Counter-clockwise turn (keep point)
- **Negative**: Clockwise turn (remove previous point)
- **Zero**: Collinear points (handle based on distance)

### Implementation Details

#### Point Class
```java
public class Point {
    private double x, y;
    
    // Cross product for three points
    public static double crossProduct(Point p1, Point p2, Point p3) {
        return (p2.x - p1.x) * (p3.y - p1.y) - (p2.y - p1.y) * (p3.x - p1.x);
    }
}
```

#### Algorithm Implementation
```java
public static List<Point> findConvexHull(List<Point> points) {
    // 1. Find bottom point
    Point bottom = findBottomPoint(points);
    
    // 2. Sort by polar angle
    List<Point> sorted = sortByPolarAngle(points, bottom);
    
    // 3. Apply Graham Scan
    return grahamScan(sorted);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: O(n log n) - sorting points by polar angle
- **Scanning**: O(n) - linear scan through sorted points
- **Total**: O(n log n)

### Space Complexity

- **Input**: O(n) - storing input points
- **Output**: O(h) - where h is the number of hull vertices
- **Total**: O(n)

### Edge Cases

#### Insufficient Points
- Less than 3 points: Cannot form a convex hull
- Exactly 3 points: Triangle (if not collinear)

#### Collinear Points
- Points on the same line are handled by distance sorting
- Only the endpoints are included in the hull

#### Duplicate Points
- Duplicates are removed before processing
- Ensures algorithm correctness

### Algorithm Correctness

The Graham Scan algorithm is correct because:

1. **Bottom Point**: The bottom-most point is always on the convex hull
2. **Polar Sorting**: Points are processed in the correct order
3. **Turn Detection**: Cross product correctly identifies turn direction
4. **Right Turn Removal**: Removing right turns maintains convexity

### Optimization Techniques

#### Early Termination
- Stop processing if only 3 points remain
- Skip duplicate points during sorting

#### Memory Management
- Use stack for efficient point removal
- Avoid unnecessary object creation

#### Numerical Stability
- Use double precision for coordinates
- Handle floating-point precision issues

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Test individual components (Point, Algorithm)
- Verify edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure numerical accuracy

#### Integration Tests
- Test complete algorithm workflow
- Verify output correctness
- Test with various point distributions

#### Performance Tests
- Measure execution time with large point sets
- Verify O(n log n) complexity
- Test memory usage

### Common Pitfalls

#### Floating-Point Precision
- Use appropriate epsilon for comparisons
- Handle rounding errors in calculations

#### Edge Case Handling
- Validate input parameters
- Handle degenerate cases gracefully

#### Memory Leaks
- Properly manage collections
- Avoid unnecessary object retention

### Future Enhancements

#### Algorithm Variants
- Implement other convex hull algorithms (Jarvis, QuickHull)
- Compare performance characteristics

#### Optimization
- Parallel processing for large datasets
- Incremental hull updates
- Memory-efficient implementations

#### Visualization
- Animate the algorithm steps
