## Slide 1: Introduction (30 seconds)

Good [morning/afternoon]. Today I'll present our project on Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning. Our objective is to develop predictive models that can identify individuals at risk of heart disease. We analyzed a dataset of 319,796 records with 18 variables using multiple machine learning algorithms.

---

## Slide 2: Dataset Description (30 seconds)

We used the Heart Disease Dataset 2020, which contains 319,796 records with 18 variables. The target variable is HeartDisease, indicating presence or absence of heart disease. One key challenge we faced was class imbalance, which we addressed using specialized techniques.

## Slide 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (45 seconds)

Our exploratory data analysis revealed several important findings. We conducted statistical tests including correlation analysis, chi-square tests, and t-tests. Based on these analyses and review of medical literature, we selected the top 5 variables that contribute most to heart disease risk prediction. These variables were chosen based on statistical significance, correlation strength, and clinical relevance.

## Slide 4: Key Findings (45 seconds)

The top 5 risk factors we identified include [list variables]. These factors showed strong statistical associations with heart disease. Our analysis validated these findings through multiple statistical tests, ensuring their reliability. These factors align with established medical knowledge about heart disease risk.

## Slide 5: Predictive Models (45 seconds)

We built and evaluated 6 different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Network. To handle the class imbalance, we applied SMOTE, a synthetic oversampling technique. Each model was trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics.

## Slide 6: Model Performance (45 seconds)

We evaluated all models using multiple metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC. The top 2 performing models were [Model 1] and [Model 2]. These models showed the best balance of performance metrics, with particularly strong AUC-ROC scores, which is crucial for imbalanced datasets.

---

## Slide 7: Model Comparison (45 seconds)

Our model selection was based on several criteria: primarily F1-Score and AUC-ROC, but also considering the balance between precision and recall, model interpretability, and computational efficiency. After comprehensive comparison, we selected Random Forest and Logistic Regression as our top models, as they demonstrated the best overall performance.

## Slide 8: Conclusion (30 seconds)

In conclusion, we successfully identified key risk factors for heart disease and developed predictive models with strong performance. The selected models can be used for early risk identification and preventive healthcare applications. This work demonstrates the potential of machine learning in clinical decision support.

## Slide 9: Further Work (30 seconds)

For future work, we recommend collecting larger datasets, exploring additional feature engineering techniques, and implementing model ensemble methods. We also emphasize the importance of addressing ethical considerations including bias mitigation, model interpretability, and privacy protection in healthcare applications.

Thank you for your attention. Are there any questions?
