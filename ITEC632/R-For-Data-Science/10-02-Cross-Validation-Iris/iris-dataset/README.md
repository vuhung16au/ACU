4. **Overfitting Detection**: Identify models that don't generalize well
5. **Algorithm Comparison**: Fair comparison between different methods

## Common Cross-Validation Techniques

### K-Fold Cross-Validation
- **5-Fold CV**: 5 folds with 30 samples each
- **10-Fold CV**: 10 folds with 15 samples each
- **Leave-One-Out CV**: 150 folds with 1 sample each (computationally expensive)

### Stratified Cross-Validation
- **Maintains Class Balance**: Each fold has equal representation of all species
- **Better Performance Estimates**: More reliable for imbalanced datasets
- **Recommended Approach**: Especially important for small datasets
