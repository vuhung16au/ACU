# Australian Compliance Framework for Algorithmic Systems

## Overview

This document outlines the Australian legal and regulatory framework for ensuring algorithmic systems comply with anti-discrimination laws, privacy requirements, and ethical AI principles.

## üèõÔ∏è Legal Foundation

### Primary Legislation

#### 1. Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)
- **Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)**: 13 principles governing data collection, use, and disclosure

#### 2. Anti-Discrimination Acts
- **Racial Discrimination Act 1975**: Prohibits race-based discrimination
- **Sex Discrimination Act 1984**: Prohibits gender-based discrimination  
- **Age Discrimination Act 2004**: Prohibits age-based discrimination
- **Disability Discrimination Act 1992**: Prohibits disability-based discrimination

#### 3. Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986
- **Section 3**: Promotes understanding and protection of human rights
- **Section 11**: Investigative powers for discriminatory practices

### State Legislation

#### New South Wales - Anti-Discrimination Act 1977
- Broader definitions of discrimination
- Extended protected attributes
- Intersectional discrimination recognition

#### Victoria - Equal Opportunity Act 2010
- Positive duties to prevent discrimination
- Proactive compliance requirements
- Regular assessment obligations

#### Queensland - Anti-Discrimination Act 1991
- Comprehensive protected attribute coverage
- Holistic fairness evaluation requirements

## üè¶ Financial Services Regulations

### Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)

#### CPS 220 - Risk Management
- Comprehensive risk management framework

#### Regulatory Guide 256 - Client Review and Remediation
- Systemic issue identification
- Algorithmic bias remediation
- Client impact assessment

## üìä Compliance Requirements

### Data Collection Compliance

#### Prohibited Attributes
- **Direct**: Gender, age, race, ethnicity, religion, disability status
- **Indirect**: Variables highly correlated with protected attributes
- **Proxy**: Location, education, occupation (when correlated with protected groups)

#### Required Practices
- Data minimization principles
- Purpose limitation adherence
- Explicit consent for sensitive data
- Clear collection notices
- Regular data audits

### Model Development Compliance

#### Design Requirements
- Protected attribute exclusion
- Proxy variable auditing
- Fairness constraint implementation
- Bias impact assessment
- Comprehensive documentation

#### Testing Obligations
- Demographic parity testing
- Equalized odds evaluation
- Intersectional bias assessment
- Statistical significance testing
- Regular validation cycles

### Deployment Compliance

#### Monitoring Requirements
- Continuous bias monitoring
- Performance tracking by groups
- Incident response procedures
- Regular compliance audits
- Staff training programs

#### Documentation Standards
- Model development records
- Bias testing results
- Fairness metric calculations
- Compliance assessment reports
- Training completion records

## ‚öñÔ∏è Risk Assessment Framework

### High-Risk Scenarios

1. **Direct Discrimination**
   - Use of protected attributes in models
   - Immediate legal violation
   - Requires immediate remediation

2. **Proxy Discrimination**
   - Variables correlated with protected attributes
   - Indirect discrimination risk
   - Requires correlation analysis and mitigation

3. **Disparate Impact**
   - Unintended discriminatory outcomes
   - Statistical disparity evidence
   - Requires impact assessment and justification

4. **Lack of Transparency**
   - Unexplainable decisions
   - Privacy principle violation
   - Requires explainable AI implementation

### Medium-Risk Scenarios

1. **Insufficient Testing**
   - Incomplete bias assessment
   - Undetected discrimination risk
   - Requires comprehensive testing protocols

2. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Incomplete compliance records
   - Regulatory demonstration failure
   - Requires documentation standards

3. **Training Deficiencies**
   - Staff unaware of bias risks
   - Unintentional bias introduction
   - Requires regular training programs

## üõ°Ô∏è Compliance Implementation

### Governance Structure

#### Required Roles
- **Compliance Officer**: Overall compliance responsibility
- **AI Ethics Committee**: Policy development and oversight
- **Bias Review Board**: Technical assessment and validation
- **External Auditor**: Independent verification

#### Responsibilities
- Policy development and maintenance
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Training program delivery
- Audit coordination and management
- Regulatory liaison and reporting

### Technical Safeguards

#### Automated Systems
- Real-time bias detection
- Fairness constraint enforcement
- Model explainability tools
- Performance monitoring dashboards
- Alert systems for violations

#### Regular Activities
- Model retraining with fairness constraints
- Demographic performance evaluation
- Proxy variable correlation analysis
- Decision explanation generation
- Bias trend monitoring and analysis

### Operational Procedures

#### Assessment Protocols
- Bias impact assessment procedures
- Model validation and testing protocols
- Incident response and remediation plans
- Audit preparation and execution processes
- Regulatory reporting and documentation

#### Execution Framework
- Regular compliance review cycles
- Comprehensive staff training programs
- External audit participation and coordination
- Active regulatory engagement and communication
- Continuous improvement and optimization initiatives
