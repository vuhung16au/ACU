# Code Audit Guidelines for Bias Detection

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for conducting code audits to detect potential sources of algorithmic bias in machine learning systems, with specific focus on Australian compliance requirements.

## üîç Audit Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Identify direct use of protected attributes
- Detect proxy variables that correlate with protected groups
- Assess fairness metrics and testing coverage
- Evaluate compliance with Australian anti-discrimination laws
- Review documentation and transparency measures

### Secondary Goals
- Identify potential sources of indirect discrimination
- Assess model explainability and interpretability
- Evaluate bias monitoring and detection systems
- Review incident response procedures
- Validate staff training and awareness

## üìã Audit Checklist

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

#### Protected Attributes
- [ ] **Direct Use**: Check for gender, age, race, ethnicity, religion, disability variables
- [ ] **Indirect Use**: Identify variables highly correlated with protected attributes
- [ ] **Proxy Variables**: Review location, education, occupation variables for bias correlation
- [ ] **Data Sources**: Assess external data sources for potential bias introduction

#### Data Quality
- [ ] **Missing Values**: Check handling of missing values across demographic groups
- [ ] **Outlier Treatment**: Review outlier detection and treatment methods
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Assess validation rules for potential bias
- [ ] **Sampling Methods**: Evaluate sampling strategies for representativeness

#### Code Patterns to Flag
```r
# RED FLAG: Direct use of protected attributes
model <- glm(outcome ~ gender + age + ethnicity + ..., data = train_data)

# RED FLAG: Proxy variables without correlation analysis
model <- glm(outcome ~ postcode + education_level + ..., data = train_data)

# RED FLAG: Missing value handling that may introduce bias
data$ethnicity[is.na(data$ethnicity)] <- "Unknown"  # May create bias
```

### 2. Model Development and Training

#### Feature Selection
- [ ] **Feature Engineering**: Review feature creation for bias introduction
- [ ] **Variable Selection**: Assess selection criteria for protected attribute proxies
- [ ] **Dimensionality Reduction**: Check PCA/feature reduction for bias preservation
- [ ] **Feature Scaling**: Review scaling methods for demographic fairness

#### Model Architecture
- [ ] **Algorithm Choice**: Evaluate algorithm selection for bias susceptibility
- [ ] **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Check tuning process for fairness considerations
- [ ] **Cross-Validation**: Assess validation strategy for demographic representation
- [ ] **Ensemble Methods**: Review ensemble techniques for bias aggregation

#### Code Patterns to Flag
```r
# RED FLAG: No fairness constraints in model training
model <- train(outcome ~ ., data = train_data, method = "glm")

# RED FLAG: Cross-validation without demographic stratification
cv_results <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

# RED FLAG: Feature selection without bias consideration
selected_features <- selectFeatures(data, method = "correlation")
```

### 3. Model Evaluation and Testing

#### Performance Metrics
- [ ] **Overall Metrics**: Check accuracy, precision, recall calculations
- [ ] **Group-Specific Metrics**: Verify performance calculation by demographic groups
- [ ] **Fairness Metrics**: Assess demographic parity, equalized odds calculations
- [ ] **Statistical Testing**: Review significance testing for bias detection

#### Testing Coverage
- [ ] **Bias Testing**: Verify comprehensive bias assessment
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Check testing of edge cases and boundary conditions
- [ ] **Adversarial Testing**: Assess robustness to adversarial inputs
- [ ] **Stress Testing**: Review performance under various conditions

#### Code Patterns to Flag
```r
# RED FLAG: Only overall performance metrics
accuracy <- confusionMatrix(predictions, actual)$overall['Accuracy']

# RED FLAG: No group-specific performance analysis
# Missing: Performance by gender, ethnicity, age groups

# RED FLAG: No fairness metrics calculation
# Missing: Demographic parity, equalized odds analysis
```

### 4. Model Deployment and Monitoring

#### Production Systems
- [ ] **Model Serving**: Check serving infrastructure for bias introduction
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Review input validation for demographic fairness
- [ ] **Output Processing**: Assess post-processing for bias mitigation
- [ ] **API Design**: Evaluate API design for transparency and fairness

#### Monitoring Systems
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Check monitoring by demographic groups
- [ ] **Bias Detection**: Verify automated bias detection systems
- [ ] **Alert Systems**: Assess alert mechanisms for bias violations
- [ ] **Dashboard Design**: Review monitoring dashboards for fairness metrics

#### Code Patterns to Flag
```r
# RED FLAG: No demographic monitoring
monitor_performance(predictions, actual)

# RED FLAG: No bias detection alerts
# Missing: Automated bias detection and alerting

# RED FLAG: No group-specific performance tracking
# Missing: Performance tracking by protected groups
```

### 5. Documentation and Transparency

#### Code Documentation
- [ ] **Variable Documentation**: Check documentation of protected attributes
- [ ] **Model Documentation**: Assess model documentation for bias considerations
- [ ] **Decision Documentation**: Review decision explanation documentation
- [ ] **Compliance Documentation**: Verify compliance assessment documentation

#### Transparency Measures
- [ ] **Model Explainability**: Check explainability tool implementation
- [ ] **Decision Rationale**: Assess decision explanation generation
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Review audit trail completeness
- [ ] **User Communication**: Evaluate user communication about algorithmic decisions

#### Code Patterns to Flag
```r
# RED FLAG: Insufficient documentation
# Missing: Documentation of bias considerations

# RED FLAG: No explainability implementation
predictions <- predict(model, new_data)

# RED FLAG: No decision explanation
# Missing: Explanation of individual decisions
```

## üîß Audit Tools and Techniques

### Static Code Analysis

#### R-Specific Tools
```r
# Check for protected attribute usage
grep("gender|age|ethnicity|race|religion|disability", code_files)

# Check for proxy variable usage without correlation analysis
grep("postcode|education|occupation|marital", code_files)

# Check for missing fairness metrics
grep("demographic_parity|equalized_odds|fairness", code_files)
```

#### General Code Analysis
- **Variable Naming**: Check variable names for protected attribute indicators
- **Comment Analysis**: Review comments for bias considerations
- **Import Analysis**: Check imported packages for bias-related functionality
- **Function Analysis**: Review function definitions for bias parameters

### Dynamic Analysis

#### Runtime Monitoring
```r
# Monitor performance by demographic groups
performance_by_group <- function(predictions, actual, groups) {
  sapply(unique(groups), function(group) {
    group_mask <- groups == group
    calculate_metrics(predictions[group_mask], actual[group_mask])
  })
}

# Check for bias drift over time
monitor_bias_drift <- function(model, data, time_periods) {
  sapply(time_periods, function(period) {
    period_data <- data[data$time == period, ]
    assess_bias(model, period_data)
  })
}
```

#### Testing Framework
```r
# Automated bias testing
test_bias <- function(model, test_data) {
  results <- list()
  
  # Test demographic parity
  results$demographic_parity <- test_demographic_parity(model, test_data)
  
  # Test equalized odds
  results$equalized_odds <- test_equalized_odds(model, test_data)
  
  # Test intersectional bias
  results$intersectional <- test_intersectional_bias(model, test_data)
  
  return(results)
}
```
