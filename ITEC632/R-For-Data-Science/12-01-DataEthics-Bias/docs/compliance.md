# Australian Legal Compliance Guide for Algorithmic Bias

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to Australian legal requirements for preventing algorithmic bias and discrimination in machine learning systems, particularly in financial services and lending decisions.

## 🏛️ Legal Framework

### 1. Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)

- **Compliance Action**: Implement data minimization - collect only attributes directly relevant to creditworthiness

#### APP 5 - Notification of Collection
- **Requirement**: Notify individuals about the collection of personal information
- **Bias Implication**: Must inform applicants about use of sensitive information in decision-making
- **Compliance Action**: Provide clear notices about data collection and algorithmic decision-making

#### APP 6 - Use or Disclosure of Personal Information
- **Requirement**: Only use personal information for the purpose for which it was collected
- **Bias Implication**: Using protected attributes for lending decisions may exceed original collection purpose
- **Compliance Action**: Ensure data use aligns with stated collection purposes

### 2. Anti-Discrimination Legislation

#### Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth)
- **Prohibition**: Direct and indirect discrimination based on race, color, descent, or ethnic origin
- **Algorithmic Application**: Models cannot use ethnicity or race-correlated variables
- **Compliance Requirement**: Regular audit of variables for racial bias

#### Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth)
- **Prohibition**: Discrimination based on sex, marital status, pregnancy, or family responsibilities
- **Algorithmic Application**: Gender and gender-correlated variables prohibited
- **Compliance Requirement**: Gender-neutral model design and testing

#### Age Discrimination Act 2004 (Cth)
- **Prohibition**: Discrimination based on age
- **Algorithmic Application**: Age-based decision-making restrictions
- **Compliance Requirement**: Age-neutral lending criteria

#### Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth)
- **Prohibition**: Discrimination based on disability
- **Algorithmic Application**: Disability-related variables and proxies prohibited
- **Compliance Requirement**: Accessibility and accommodation considerations

### 3. State Anti-Discrimination Acts

#### New South Wales - Anti-Discrimination Act 1977
- **Additional Protections**: Broader definitions of discrimination
- **Algorithmic Considerations**: Extended protected attributes and intersectional discrimination

#### Section 11 - Functions
- **Investigation**: Power to investigate discriminatory practices
- **Algorithmic Scope**: Includes algorithmic decision-making systems

## 🏦 Financial Services Specific Requirements

### Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)

#### CPS 220 - Risk Management
- **Requirement**: Comprehensive risk management framework
- **Algorithmic Risk**: Include bias and fairness risks in risk assessments
- **Compliance Action**: Regular algorithmic risk assessments

#### CPS 234 - Information Security
- **Data Protection**: Secure handling of sensitive information
- **Algorithmic Consideration**: Protect against bias in data processing

### Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)

#### Responsible Lending Obligations
- **Requirement**: Lending decisions based on creditworthiness alone
- **Algorithmic Application**: Models must not use prohibited attributes
- **Compliance Action**: Regular model validation for fairness

#### Regulatory Guide 256 - Client Review and Remediation
- **Requirement**: Identify and remediate systemic issues
- **Algorithmic Scope**: Includes algorithmic bias and discrimination
