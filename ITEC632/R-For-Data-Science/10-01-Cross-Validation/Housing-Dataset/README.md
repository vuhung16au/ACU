## Data Quality Notes

- Some features have missing values (NA)
- Categorical variables are encoded as text
- Numerical variables may have outliers
- Some features are highly correlated with the target variable (SalePrice)

## Usage in Cross-Validation

This dataset is ideal for cross-validation exercises because:
1. It has a clear regression target (SalePrice)
2. It contains both categorical and numerical features
3. It has missing values that require preprocessing
4. It's large enough to demonstrate cross-validation benefits
5. It's commonly used in machine learning education
